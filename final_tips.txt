bit: bartender had a bit of an icy personality, but server was nice
sauce: secondly  these corn tortillas are insane! just one thin perfectly toasted tortilla can hold a heavy serving of meat and sauce beautifully
mushroom: my friend ordered a few tacos, and hongos, the mushroom taco, was the best
price: taco price is normal for nyc, 4$ for all of them except the shrimp 6$
college: my friend back in college came on assignment from japan and we planned to catch up at a different mexican restaurant originally
weather: they have outdoor seating and the ambiance is good for people watching when the weather is nice
reason: they were pretty strong which is probably the reason why people like this place to begin with
plancha: pescado tacos were great, guacamole and pascado ala plancha was delicious and also had a beautiful display
stretch: with a perfect taste and perfect stretch, these agile homemade tortillas automatically put these tacos in the lead of best tacos in ny! guac and salsa with homemade chips were $12 and a crunchy harbinger of flavor for the amazing tacos to come! david, our awesome server was a sweetheart and gave me a couple tortillas to go when i told him how impressed i was by their stamina :  this is just the best food i have ever had and what made it worth while was the tortillas being made fresh
