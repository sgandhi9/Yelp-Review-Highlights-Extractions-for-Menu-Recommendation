this is a great addition to the neighborhood 
they've got cool bathrooms downstairs in the basement and a station where you wash your hands kinda weird but cool    gender neutral! there's a station on the first floor in the middle of the dining area where they make tacos in front of you???  i think so, but no1 was sitting there at the moment  
i thought that was really cool 
they also have complimentary sparking water   water brought to your table in two large glass pitchers 
  service was great here! waiter knew what was going on and could guide us in the right direction for the top selections on the menu 
i ate the pozole de pollo!     it was good but too much corn for me 
i believe it's a mexican corn, which is harder and not sweet 
 however! the stew 
 
amazeballs  
i believe the entire menu is 
 
 
a go!  aka yes, place your order with confidence that it'll be delicious no matter what you choose 
 definitely recommend you to stop by 
they're drinks are also  thumbs up  rosie's is fun and clean 
there is plenty of light and greet views of everyone out on the street 
the servers are friendly and fun 
and, the food is really tasty and comes out hot 
they have delicious guacamole and corn tortilla chips!the guacamole was a bit spicy so it was a nice appetizer 
it also came with two sauces, a sweet one like bbq sauce and a little bit spicy one 
however, i don't think the sauces went well with the guac 
the chips were housemade and seasoned with just enough salt 
the main dish, huevos ahogados, was two poached eggs in a kale mushroom soup 
eggs were perfectly cooked 
the soup was very sour  i didn't like sour soup very much , but it was delicious when mixed with the egg yolks 
the mushrooms were delicious in the soup 
my friend ordered a few tacos, and hongos, the mushroom taco, was the best 
he ordered two more at the end 
they offered free sparkling water and lemons, along with tap water, which was a plus for a restaurant of this price level 
my friend back in college came on assignment from japan and we planned to catch up at a different mexican restaurant originally 
but when we passed by rosie's, we were amazed by its beautiful outdoor seating and decided to give it a shot 
while we were waiting for our food, sam smith with his partner passed by us out of blue 
my first celebrity come across ever, coincidently!!!that aside, rosie's had really delicious pork sandwich, or torta de carnitas, which the waitress told me is a traditional mexican sandwich 
the hand pulled pork meet was so tender and juicy and was marinated nicely that went well with the chewy bread 
although it was a little greasy, it was the yummy part 
i've had better tortilla that, even when it's cold, it still can keep the texture 
we share the citrica salad that our waitress recommended, but i don't think it's worth the $12 
nothing special or surprisingly good; it was just a plate of grape fruits and pineapples with some lettuce 
we each also ordered a margarita, watermelon for my friend and rosie's for me, but  mine took like 15 mins because the bartender forgot our order 
the waitress was very nice and kept apologizing, but both our drinks were okay 
for $12 or $14, i've had better so i think you can skip those two 
another negative thing is, they don't have complementary nachos and guacamole and cost you $7 : if the weather is nice, come and try their sorta de carnitas 
great fish tacos, amazing and creative mexican brunch options, which includes a 
moody maria  made with tequila instead of vodka , and a friendly/knowledgeable staff 
one of my favorite places in nyc for mexican  probably my favorite  
everything looked delicious and was instagram worthy 
they were pretty strong which is probably the reason why people like this place to begin with 
very good pour over coffee $3 
  and tacos 
brunch dishes were pretty good but nothing extraordinary 
i'm a big fan of mexican food and this place definitely hit the spot 
our waitress was a doll and was very attentive 
their drinks were delicious and strong 
i got a few skinny margaritas 
pescado tacos were great, guacamole and pascado ala plancha was delicious and also had a beautiful display 
if you're a vegetarian, they have a lot of vegetarian options 
i highly recommend this place! i came to rosie's for dinner because everyone raved about how it's one of the best mexican restaurants in new york and i definitely see why! we were seated pretty quickly to our table 
rosie's also has great outdoor seating options, perfect for the summer 
the staff was also really friendly, our waiter was attentive and kept checking on us but not too much that was felt rushed to leave 
we ended up ordering the watermelon margaritas, fish, beef & chicken tacos  $4 each , corn and chips & salsa 
everything was amazing!! only negative was the slightly high prices but totally worth it for the quality of the food! really enjoyed rosie's 
the staff was very good 
the food was delicious and the atmosphere was just right 
i didn't like the margaritas as much as i thought i would, but the ceviche was fantastic 
highly recommend the guacamole too!  absolutely will come back next time i am in nyc 
came for happy hour on a weekday, and had a good time 
note the bar area seats  10!! so get there early 
one of the hh food  options are tacos $5 for 2! best deal in town and they were so delicious 
we tried them all   all 5 options 
my favorite surprisingly wasn't the fish   which was food, but i actually liked the flavors of the pork the most 
the veggie one was flavorful but was just ok 
would come back  for hh / try dinner 
one of my favorite things to do is eat outside 
pair that with good mexican food and it's a dream come true 
rosie's is where you want to be if you're craving something good and refreshing in the east village 
those tortillas are the real deal 
i am pretty sure that these are some of the best tortillas you can get in manhattan, and that translates into how good the tacos/quesadillas/etc 
the outside dining area and open floor to ceiling windows create this awesome atmosphere where you can really sit down and relax 
the service is good 
the watermelon margarita is the perfect summer refreshment 
it's worth trying and has some of the best mexican food in the city 
definitely come here for the spicy margarita    delicious! the food is just okay, as is all mexican food in new york 
and this place is super expensive for mexican food, but i supposed standard for nyc prices 
bartender had a bit of an icy personality, but server was nice 
took awhile for someone to get to us, but the food came our super quick after we ordered 
they have outdoor seating and the ambiance is good for people watching when the weather is nice 
i cam for brunch with friends a few weekends ago and i had a great time 
we made a reservation a few days before because it was a large party otherwise we would have never gotten in because it was packed at 1:15pm on a saturday afternoon 
for the table, we order pitchers of the classic margarita, guacamole, and queso fundido 
everything was really good especially the guacamole!for lunch, i ordered the al pastor taco and the shrimp taco 
my favorite was the al pastor taco which is pork, pineapple, and avocado tomatillo salsa 
the atmosphere and d cor is great and the service was amazing as well 
i would definitely go back for drinks and appetizers! this is the first mexican place i went to eat in at nyc! i really enjoyed the experience esp with my church sisters! we had a reservation and the tables were all set up and ready! they were really nice and asked us a few times if we wanted chips and guacamole for starters 
refills were free  awesome!!  haha i was very glad about that 
it was dim lighting, and toilets are downstairs, where everyone share same washing hand space! so don't be alarmed when you see males waiting on line with you haha 
the chips and guacamole taste like normal, crunchy and the red salsa is spicy 
nothing too special 
the pork taco    el pastor   was delicious! i like the lime flavor, the sauce was minimal, it was so satisfying after eating one taco 
i also ordered a fish taco, which i enjoyed less because of the spicy creme slapped on top  was too much for me   so i wiped some off 
didn't love the white veggie on top as well 
the fried fish was crunchy and soft! the check was around 198$ for 9 people, and we paid for our bday girl 
so total was around 20$ worth the experience because of the people!service was kind, patient, and joyful 
taco price is normal for nyc, 4$ for all of them except the shrimp 6$ 
order the watermelon margarita and 2 
order the pescado tacos, you my friend have actually never been to rosie's 
so try again 
absolutely no regrets, and even after being full my taste buds still made me order more tacos 
$4 for the best fish taco i have ever had and great pitcher deals 
why wait any longer for those tacos? this is always a great go to mexican spot for big or small groups 
i especially like it in the summertime when its completely open windowed 
i looove their guac and margs and love that you can usually get a reservation 
the hype is not real 
after i was recommended by two different people i decided to give rosie's a try 
we ended up getting seated at the taco bar, so that was super cool 
however, i'd recommend waiting for an actual table, it wasn't conducive to eating if you're like us and order a feast 
we got the el pastor and the fish tacos 
i drank so much water trying to cool my mouth 
for our main dish i got the chorizo fundido and my date went for the steak 
the steak was good 
the vegetables that came with the steak was borderline comical 
my date basically got a full onion with a few pieces of pepper and a undercooked shallot 
overall, i've had much better tacos elsewhere 
i even went to another taco spot a few days later declaring i can't let this be my last taco experience 
the service was slow but who could blame them, they were packed 
food was not enjoyable for me, sorry you can't have the default of your tacos be flaming hot and expect everyone to just love spice 
how the hell did i never come here until now?!first of all, the tacos literally stand on their own 
secondly  these corn tortillas are insane! just one thin perfectly toasted tortilla can hold a heavy serving of meat and sauce beautifully 
with a perfect taste and perfect stretch, these agile homemade tortillas automatically put these tacos in the lead of best tacos in ny! guac and salsa with homemade chips were $12 and a crunchy harbinger of flavor for the amazing tacos to come! david, our awesome server was a sweetheart and gave me a couple tortillas to go when i told him how impressed i was by their stamina :  this is just the best food i have ever had and what made it worth while was the tortillas being made fresh 
the guacamole was zesty and spot on 
the pescado taco is addictive, you only get one per order but you can eat 4 or 5 to satisfy you 
i wouldnt order the  pitcher of watermelon margarita but the glass was spot on 
this is a great addition to the neighborhood

this is a great addition to the neighborhood 
they've got cool bathrooms downstairs in the basement and a station where you wash your hands kinda weird but cool    gender neutral! there's a station on the first floor in the middle of the dining area where they make tacos in front of you???  i think so, but no1 was sitting there at the moment  
i thought that was really cool 
they also have complimentary sparking water   water brought to your table in two large glass pitchers 
  service was great here! waiter knew what was going on and could guide us in the right direction for the top selections on the menu 
i ate the pozole de pollo!     it was good but too much corn for me 
i believe it's a mexican corn, which is harder and not sweet 
 however! the stew 
 
amazeballs  
i believe the entire menu is 
 
 
a go!  aka yes, place your order with confidence that it'll be delicious no matter what you choose 
 definitely recommend you to stop by 
they're drinks are also  thumbs up  rosie's is fun and clean 
there is plenty of light and greet views of everyone out on the street 
the servers are friendly and fun 
and, the food is really tasty and comes out hot 
they have delicious guacamole and corn tortilla chips!the guacamole was a bit spicy so it was a nice appetizer 
it also came with two sauces, a sweet one like bbq sauce and a little bit spicy one 
however, i don't think the sauces went well with the guac 
the chips were housemade and seasoned with just enough salt 
the main dish, huevos ahogados, was two poached eggs in a kale mushroom soup 
eggs were perfectly cooked 
the soup was very sour  i didn't like sour soup very much , but it was delicious when mixed with the egg yolks 
the mushrooms were delicious in the soup 
my friend ordered a few tacos, and hongos, the mushroom taco, was the best 
he ordered two more at the end 
they offered free sparkling water and lemons, along with tap water, which was a plus for a restaurant of this price level 
my friend back in college came on assignment from japan and we planned to catch up at a different mexican restaurant originally 
but when we passed by rosie's, we were amazed by its beautiful outdoor seating and decided to give it a shot 
while we were waiting for our food, sam smith with his partner passed by us out of blue 
my first celebrity come across ever, coincidently!!!that aside, rosie's had really delicious pork sandwich, or torta de carnitas, which the waitress told me is a traditional mexican sandwich 
the hand pulled pork meet was so tender and juicy and was marinated nicely that went well with the chewy bread 
although it was a little greasy, it was the yummy part 
i've had better tortilla that, even when it's cold, it still can keep the texture 
we share the citrica salad that our waitress recommended, but i don't think it's worth the $12 
nothing special or surprisingly good; it was just a plate of grape fruits and pineapples with some lettuce 
we each also ordered a margarita, watermelon for my friend and rosie's for me, but  mine took like 15 mins because the bartender forgot our order 
the waitress was very nice and kept apologizing, but both our drinks were okay 
for $12 or $14, i've had better so i think you can skip those two 
another negative thing is, they don't have complementary nachos and guacamole and cost you $7 : if the weather is nice, come and try their sorta de carnitas 
great fish tacos, amazing and creative mexican brunch options, which includes a 
moody maria  made with tequila instead of vodka , and a friendly/knowledgeable staff 
one of my favorite places in nyc for mexican  probably my favorite  
everything looked delicious and was instagram worthy 
they were pretty strong which is probably the reason why people like this place to begin with 
very good pour over coffee $3 
  and tacos 
brunch dishes were pretty good but nothing extraordinary 
i'm a big fan of mexican food and this place definitely hit the spot 
our waitress was a doll and was very attentive 
their drinks were delicious and strong 
i got a few skinny margaritas 
pescado tacos were great, guacamole and pascado ala plancha was delicious and also had a beautiful display 
if you're a vegetarian, they have a lot of vegetarian options 
i highly recommend this place! i came to rosie's for dinner because everyone raved about how it's one of the best mexican restaurants in new york and i definitely see why! we were seated pretty quickly to our table 
rosie's also has great outdoor seating options, perfect for the summer 
the staff was also really friendly, our waiter was attentive and kept checking on us but not too much that was felt rushed to leave 
we ended up ordering the watermelon margaritas, fish, beef & chicken tacos  $4 each , corn and chips & salsa 
everything was amazing!! only negative was the slightly high prices but totally worth it for the quality of the food! really enjoyed rosie's 
the staff was very good 
the food was delicious and the atmosphere was just right 
i didn't like the margaritas as much as i thought i would, but the ceviche was fantastic 
highly recommend the guacamole too!  absolutely will come back next time i am in nyc 
came for happy hour on a weekday, and had a good time 
note the bar area seats  10!! so get there early 
one of the hh food  options are tacos $5 for 2! best deal in town and they were so delicious 
we tried them all   all 5 options 
my favorite surprisingly wasn't the fish   which was food, but i actually liked the flavors of the pork the most 
the veggie one was flavorful but was just ok 
would come back  for hh / try dinner 
one of my favorite things to do is eat outside 
pair that with good mexican food and it's a dream come true 
rosie's is where you want to be if you're craving something good and refreshing in the east village 
those tortillas are the real deal 
i am pretty sure that these are some of the best tortillas you can get in manhattan, and that translates into how good the tacos/quesadillas/etc 
the outside dining area and open floor to ceiling windows create this awesome atmosphere where you can really sit down and relax 
the service is good 
the watermelon margarita is the perfect summer refreshment 
it's worth trying and has some of the best mexican food in the city 
definitely come here for the spicy margarita    delicious! the food is just okay, as is all mexican food in new york 
and this place is super expensive for mexican food, but i supposed standard for nyc prices 
bartender had a bit of an icy personality, but server was nice 
took awhile for someone to get to us, but the food came our super quick after we ordered 
they have outdoor seating and the ambiance is good for people watching when the weather is nice 
i cam for brunch with friends a few weekends ago and i had a great time 
we made a reservation a few days before because it was a large party otherwise we would have never gotten in because it was packed at 1:15pm on a saturday afternoon 
for the table, we order pitchers of the classic margarita, guacamole, and queso fundido 
everything was really good especially the guacamole!for lunch, i ordered the al pastor taco and the shrimp taco 
my favorite was the al pastor taco which is pork, pineapple, and avocado tomatillo salsa 
the atmosphere and d cor is great and the service was amazing as well 
i would definitely go back for drinks and appetizers! this is the first mexican place i went to eat in at nyc! i really enjoyed the experience esp with my church sisters! we had a reservation and the tables were all set up and ready! they were really nice and asked us a few times if we wanted chips and guacamole for starters 
refills were free  awesome!!  haha i was very glad about that 
it was dim lighting, and toilets are downstairs, where everyone share same washing hand space! so don't be alarmed when you see males waiting on line with you haha 
the chips and guacamole taste like normal, crunchy and the red salsa is spicy 
nothing too special 
the pork taco    el pastor   was delicious! i like the lime flavor, the sauce was minimal, it was so satisfying after eating one taco 
i also ordered a fish taco, which i enjoyed less because of the spicy creme slapped on top  was too much for me   so i wiped some off 
didn't love the white veggie on top as well 
the fried fish was crunchy and soft! the check was around 198$ for 9 people, and we paid for our bday girl 
so total was around 20$ worth the experience because of the people!service was kind, patient, and joyful 
taco price is normal for nyc, 4$ for all of them except the shrimp 6$ 
order the watermelon margarita and 2 
order the pescado tacos, you my friend have actually never been to rosie's 
so try again 
absolutely no regrets, and even after being full my taste buds still made me order more tacos 
$4 for the best fish taco i have ever had and great pitcher deals 
why wait any longer for those tacos? this is always a great go to mexican spot for big or small groups 
i especially like it in the summertime when its completely open windowed 
i looove their guac and margs and love that you can usually get a reservation 
the hype is not real 
after i was recommended by two different people i decided to give rosie's a try 
we ended up getting seated at the taco bar, so that was super cool 
however, i'd recommend waiting for an actual table, it wasn't conducive to eating if you're like us and order a feast 
we got the el pastor and the fish tacos 
i drank so much water trying to cool my mouth 
for our main dish i got the chorizo fundido and my date went for the steak 
the steak was good 
the vegetables that came with the steak was borderline comical 
my date basically got a full onion with a few pieces of pepper and a undercooked shallot 
overall, i've had much better tacos elsewhere 
i even went to another taco spot a few days later declaring i can't let this be my last taco experience 
the service was slow but who could blame them, they were packed 
food was not enjoyable for me, sorry you can't have the default of your tacos be flaming hot and expect everyone to just love spice 
how the hell did i never come here until now?!first of all, the tacos literally stand on their own 
secondly  these corn tortillas are insane! just one thin perfectly toasted tortilla can hold a heavy serving of meat and sauce beautifully 
with a perfect taste and perfect stretch, these agile homemade tortillas automatically put these tacos in the lead of best tacos in ny! guac and salsa with homemade chips were $12 and a crunchy harbinger of flavor for the amazing tacos to come! david, our awesome server was a sweetheart and gave me a couple tortillas to go when i told him how impressed i was by their stamina :  this is just the best food i have ever had and what made it worth while was the tortillas being made fresh 
the guacamole was zesty and spot on
